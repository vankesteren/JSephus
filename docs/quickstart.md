# Quick-start guide
Here's how to quickly get up and running with a `JSephus` element on your webpage.

## Loading the library
Besides downloading the minified or standard library from the [releases](http://github.com/vankesteren/JSephus/releases/latest) and serving it yourself, you can also make use of the [RawGit CDN](https://rawgit.com/). For this,
add the following to the `<head>` in your `html`:

```{html}
<script type="text/javascript" src="https://cdn.rawgit.com/vankesteren/JSephus/16847ef7/JSephus.min.js"></script>
``` 

## The parent element
The parent element should be an `SVG` element. This can either be static on the page, generated by your own code, or by the static method [`JSephus.createSVG()`](docpage#createsvg). The result should look somewhat like this:

```{html}
<div class="jsph-container">
  <svg id="jsph-svg" viewBox="0 0 512 512" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"> 
    
  </svg>
</div>
```

## Loading the element
The element can then be loaded by instantiating a new class and calling the [`init()`](docpage#init) method. The class constructor asks for two parameters: the parent element or its html `id` and the desired number of circles.

```{javascript}
var jsph = new JSephus("jsph-svg", 12);
jsph.init();
```

The result: a `JSephus` loading element!

<div class="jsph-container">
  <svg id="jsph-svg" viewBox="0 0 512 512" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"> 
  </svg>
</div>

<script type="text/javascript"> 
  var jsph = new JSephus("jsph-svg", 12);
  jsph.init();
</script>

## Styling the element
Using the method [`setProperty()`](docpage#setProperty) it's possible to style the element to your heart's content. Want to know which properties are available? Refer to the [documentation](docpage#properties).

## Using the element
`JSephus` is designed to interact with other code, so the variable `jsph` we created is directly linked to the element on the page. To update the loader, simply call the method [`setProgress()`](docpage#setProgress), with as its argument the proportion of progress obtained. `JSephus` does the rest. In fact, you can try the following code in the developer console right now and see the element we created earlier change!

```{javascript}
jsph.setProgress(0.8);
```
